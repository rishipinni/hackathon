## Problem statement 
Electricity generation using renewable resources, Due to inefficiencies in the current power distribution system, there is a risk of energy waste and inconsistent service for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, street lights, and traffic signals. Unreliable power generation from the hybrid wind turbine combined with inadequate distribution infrastructure makes it difficult to effectively use renewable energy sources., The following individuals are dealing with the issue of inefficient power distribution for traffic signals, street lights, and EV charging.
## About the project
The goal of the project is to enhance the efficiency of energy output by optimizing the design and operation of hybrid wind turbines. To improve overall performance, this entails optimizing positioning tactics, enhancing blade design, and putting in place intelligent control systems., The project solves the inefficiencies in power generation and distribution for street lighting, traffic signals, and electric vehicle charging by streamlining the design of the hybrid wind turbine and putting in place a smart power distribution system. Energy management software and Internet of Things (IoT) integration improves system stability, lowers energy waste, and encourages the use of renewable energy sources.
## Technical implemntaion 
-->Managing User Input:
-To construct a web application, use Flask.
-Users can enter parameters using an HTML form.

Process data and handle form submission using Flask routes.

-->Reverse Processing:
-To model wind turbine behavior, use the given RungeKutta function.
-Compute the angular velocity and current through the inductor, then plot the results.
-To be displayed on the frontend, save plots as pictures.

-->Display at Front End:
-Result page rendered with generated charts and simulation information.
-To directly integrate graphs into HTML, use base64 encoding.
-->Whole Flow:
-The web form is used by the user to enter car parameters.
-Runge-Kutta simulation execution and form submission are handled by Flask.
-On the result page, plots are created and shown.

## Techstacks used 
`PYTHON`,`Mathematical calculations`,`Data input/output operations`,'HTML','REPLIT WEBSITE','MATPLOTLIB FOR VISUALIZATION'

## How to run locally 
To run the Flask project from another laptop, follow these steps:

-->Access the project: Open the project link you provided (https://replit.com/@9921005252/Python).

-->Access the code: Review the project files to understand its structure and dependencies.

-->Fork the project: If you want to make changes to the project, click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the Replit interface. This creates a copy of the project in your Replit account that you can modify.

-->Run the Flask application:
Open the main.py file, which likely contains the code to start the Flask server.
Find the "Run" button and click on it to start the Flask server. This will host the website locally on the laptop.
-->Access the website:
Once the Flask server is running, you'll see output in the console indicating the URL where the server is hosted, such as http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Open a web browser on the laptop and enter the URL to access the website.
-->Interact with the website:
You can now interact with the website as intended. Follow any prompts or instructions provided by the website interface.
